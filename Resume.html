        <p><u>Ultrafast Optical Spectroscopy of Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites (HOIPs):</u><br>
        Though the last several years have seen rapid improvements in reported photovoltaic performance of
        perovskite-based solar cells, the underlying photophysics of perovskites remain under debate. I am
        expoloring the nature of photoexcited states in low-dimensional perovskites, with a focus on developing
        optical measurement techniques that allow for broadband spectral detection at a sub-picosecond
        timescale. This work has highlighted the importance of the interaction between photoexcited states and
        the crystalline lattice.</p>

        <p><u>Transport Measurements of Graphene-Based Materials:</u><br>
        Multilayer graphene holds exciting potential for electronic, spintronic, and valleytronic applications due
        to its unique band structure. I study properties of this band structure using electronic transport
        measurements of multilayer graphene devices down to cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields.</p>

        <p><u>Optical Imaging of Liquid Crystals in Magnetic Fields:</u><br>
        The behavior of liquid crystals under a magnetic field is predicted by theory but has not been proven by
        experiment. I helped design and build an optical microsocopy setup with the capability of reaching
        record magnetic fields for this type of experiment. This work will not only help validate theoretical
        predictions, but it could also open up a novel way of reliably measuring anchoring strength at liquid
        crystal interfaces.</p>

                <b>Direct Observation of Electron–Phonon Coupling and Slow Vibrational Relaxation in 
                Organic–Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</b><br>
                <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b08175"><em>DOI link</em></a><br>
                Quantum and dielectric confinement effects in Ruddlesden-Popper 2D hybrid perovskites create excitons 
                with a binding energy exceeding 150 meV. We exploit the large exciton binding energy to study 
                exciton and carrier dynamics as well as electron–phonon coupling (EPC) in hybrid perovskites using 
                absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. At temperatures &lt;75 K, we resolve 
                splitting of the excitonic absorption and PL into multiple regularly spaced resonances every 40–46 
                meV, consistent with EPC to phonons located on the organic cation. We also resolve resonances with 
                a 14 meV spacing, in accord with coupling to phonons with mixed organic and inorganic character. 
                These assignments are supported by density-functional theory calculations. Hot exciton PL and time-
                resolved PL measurements show that vibrational relaxation occurs on a picosecond time scale 
                competitive with that for PL. At temperatures &gt;75 K, excitonic absorption and PL exhibit 
                homogeneous broadening. While absorption remains homogeneous, PL becomes inhomogeneous at 
                temperatures &lt;75K, which we speculate is caused by the formation and subsequent dynamics of a 
                polaronic exciton.

                <b>Large-area epitaxial growth of curvature-stabilized ABC trilayer graphene</b><br>

                The properties of van der Waals (vdW) materials often vary dramatically with the atomic stacking 
                order between layers, but this order can be difficult to control. Trilayer graphene (TLG) stacks 
                in either a semimetallic ABA or a semiconducting ABC configuration with a gate-tunable band gap, 
                but the latter has only been produced by exfoliation. Here we present a chemical vapor 
                deposition approach to TLG growth that yields greatly enhanced fraction and size of ABC domains. 
                The key insight is that substrate curvature can stabilize ABC domains. Controllable ABC yields 
                ~59% were achieved by tailoring substrate curvature levels. ABC fractions remained high after 
                transfer to device substrates, as confirmed by transport measurements revealing the expected 
                tunable ABC band gap. Substrate topography engineering provides a path to large-scale synthesis 
                of epitaxial ABC-TLG and other vdW materials.

                We investigated Xe binding in a previously reported paramagnetic metal–organic tetrahedral 
                capsule, [Co4L6]4–, where L2– = 4,4′-bis[(2-pyridinylmethylene)amino][1,1′-biphenyl]-2,2′-disulfonate. 
                The Xe-inclusion complex, [XeCo4L6]4–, was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to be the dominant 
                species in aqueous solution saturated with Xe gas. The measured Xe dissociation rate in 
                [XeCo4L6]4–, koff = 4.45(5) × 102 s–1, was at least 40 times greater than that in the analogous 
                [XeFe4L6]4– complex, highlighting the capability of metal–ligand interactions to tune the capsule 
                size and guest permeability. The rapid exchange of 129Xe nuclei in [XeCo4L6]4– produced significant 
                hyperpolarized 129Xe chemical exchange saturation transfer (hyper-CEST) NMR signal at 298 K, detected 
                at a concentration of [XeCo4L6]4– as low as 100 pM, with presaturation at −89 ppm, which was referenced 
                to solvated 129Xe in H2O. The saturation offset was highly temperature-dependent with a slope of 
                −0.41(3) ppm/K, which is attributed to hyperfine interactions between the encapsulated 129Xe nucleus 
                and electron spins on the four CoII centers. As such, [XeCo4L6]4– represents the first example of a 
                paramagnetic hyper-CEST (paraHYPERCEST) sensor. Remarkably, the hyper-CEST 129Xe NMR resonance for 
                [XeCo4L6]4– (δ = −89 ppm) was shifted 105 ppm upfield from the diamagnetic analogue [XeFe4L6]4– 
                (δ = +16 ppm). The Xe inclusion complex was further characterized in the crystal structure of 
                (C(NH2)3)4[Xe0.7Co4L6]·75 H2O (1). Hydrogen bonding between capsule-linker sulfonate groups and 
                exogenous guanidinium cations, (C(NH2)3)+, stabilized capsule–capsule interactions in the solid 
                state and also assisted in trapping a Xe atom (∼42 Å3) in the large (135 Å3) cavity of 1. Magnetic 
                susceptibility measurements confirmed the presence of four noninteracting, magnetically anisotropic 
                high-spin CoII centers in 1. Furthermore, [Co4L6]4– was found to be stable toward aggregation and 
                oxidation, and the CEST performance of [XeCo4L6]4– was unaffected by biological macromolecules in 
                H2O. These results recommend metal–organic capsules for fundamental investigations of Xe host–guest 
                chemistry as well as applications with highly sensitive 129Xe-based sensors.

                <b>Tailoring Hot Exciton Dynamics in 2D Hybrid Perovskites through Cation Modification</b><br>
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c00037"><em>DOI link</em></a><br>
                We report a family of two-dimensional hybrid perovskites (2DHPs) based on phenethylammonium 
                lead iodide ((PEA)2PbI4) that show complex structure in their low-temperature excitonic 
                absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as hot exciton PL. We replace the 
                2-position (ortho) H on the phenyl group of the PEA cation with F, Cl, or Br to 
                systematically increase the cation’s cross-sectional area and mass and study changes in 
                the excitonic structure. These single atom substitutions substantially change the observable 
                number of and spacing between discrete resonances in the excitonic absorption and PL spectra 
                and drastically increase the amount of hot exciton PL that violates Kasha’s rule by over an 
                order of magnitude. To fit the progressively larger cations, the inorganic framework 
                distorts and is strained, reducing the Pb–I–Pb bond angles and increasing the 2DHP band gap. 
                Correlation between the 2DHP structure and steady-state and time-resolved spectra suggests 
                the complex structure of resonances arises from one or two manifolds of states, depending on 
                the 2DHP Pb–I–Pb bond angle (as)symmetry, and the resonances within a manifold are regularly 
                spaced with an energy separation that decreases as the mass of the cation increases. The 
                uniform separation between resonances and the dynamics that show excitons can only relax to 
                the next-lowest state are consistent with a vibronic progression caused by a vibrational 
                mode on the cation. These results demonstrate that simple changes to the cation can be used 
                to tailor the properties and dynamics of the confined excitons without directly modifying 
                the inorganic framework.

                Topology and strong electron correlations are crucial ingredients in emerging 
                quantum materials, yet their intersection in experimental systems has been 
                relatively limited to date. Strongly correlated Weyl semimetals, particularly 
                when magnetism is incorporated, offer a unique and fertile platform to 
                explore emergent phenomena in novel topological matter and topological 
                spintronics. The antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn exhibits many exotic 
                physical properties such as a large spontaneous Hall effect and has recently 
                attracted intense interest. In this work, we report synthesis of epitaxial 
                Mn3+xSn1−x films with greatly extended compositional range in comparison with 
                that of bulk samples. As Sn atoms are replaced by magnetic Mn atoms, the Kondo 
                effect, which is a celebrated example of strong correlations, emerges, 
                develops coherence, and induces a hybridization energy gap. The magnetic 
                doping and gap opening lead to rich extraordinary properties, as exemplified 
                by the prominent DC Hall effects and resonance-enhanced terahertz Faraday 
                rotation.

                The topological kagome magnet (TKM) Fe3Sn2 exhibits unusual topological properties, flat electronic 
                bands, and chiral spin textures, making it an exquisite materials platform to explore the interplay 
                between topological band structure, strong electron correlations, and magnetism. Here we report the 
                synthesis of high-quality epitaxial (0001) Fe3Sn2 films with large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect 
                close to that measured in bulk single crystals. In addition, we measured a large, anisotropic 
                anomalous Nernst coefficient Syx of 1.26μVK−1, roughly 2–5 times greater than that of common 
                ferromagnets, suggesting the presence of Berry curvature sources near the Fermi level in this 
                system. Crucially, the realization of high-quality Fe3Sn2 films opens the door to explore emergent 
                interfacial physics and create novel spintronic devices based on TKMs by interfacing Fe3Sn2 with 
                other quantum materials and by nanostructure patterning.
