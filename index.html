        <p>Welcome to my page! I am currently a doctoral physics student at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in experimental solid state physics. Generally this involves lasers, cryogenics, and working with various types of measurement equipment. Below you will find a set of links that may or may not be updated at some point in the future. I'm sorry if my HTML gives you indigestion :)</p>
