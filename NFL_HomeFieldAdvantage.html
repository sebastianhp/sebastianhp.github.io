        Something you always hear about is how home teams tend to have 
        the advantage in a game. I checked Reddit to see if anyone had posted 
        anything on this but the closest I got were analyses of 
        <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4p71fe/every_nfl_score_that_hashas_never_occurred_ocos/">
                nfl scores that have never ocurred
        </a> and a 
        <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1vyjqb/visualization_of_scores_from_every_nfl_game_ever/">
                bare distribution of scores
        </a>, and so I decided to do some quantitative analysis of my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br><br>
          I looked at every professional football score from 1920 till 
          today and 
          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uSTL3QB.png">
                  plotted the distribution.
          </a> 
        </p>

        <p>
          The gray diagonal indicates ties, and if home field advantage had 
          no effect on the outcome we would expect the weighted average of 
          the scores to lie on this line. However, as shown, the weighted 
          average actually sits at (away points, home points) = (18.4, 21.5). 
          From this graph I also define home field advantage to be the distance 
          between the weighted average and the diagonal (I'd love to hear 
          people's ideas on how else to quantify home field advantage). 
          This distance comes out to be very close to 2 points.

                Below is an inset of the distribution
        </a>
         which gives a better sense for the structure of the distribution 
        </p>

        <p>
        <br><br>I also looked at the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OzCHZUF.png">
                point differential density function (right axis)</a>.
        </p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OzCHZUF.png" alt="Point differential
            density function" width="700">
        
        <p>
        For a given point differential, this computes 
        (home wins - away wins)/total games. Therefore, the range of values 
        that this can take on fall between -1 and 1. If the home (away) team 
        always wins then this graph would be constantly 1 (-1), whereas if 
        home field advantage had no effect we would expect a flatline at 0. 
        For all point differentials the home team manages to get the advantage. 
        I also overlaid a plot of the total number of games that have ocurred at 
        a given point differential (left axis), which gives an idea of the 
        effect of normalization on each point (note that I normalize by the 
        total games at that point differential, NOT total games for all point 
        differentials). For this plot I ignore point differentials that ocurred 
        less than 5 times (which conveniently end up being point differentials 
        above 50).
        </p>

        <p>
        <br><br>Lastly I look at the 
        <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Uagxb1v.png">
                distribution of what I call the symmetric element ratios
        </a>. 
        </p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uagxb1v.png" alt="Symmetric element ratios"
            width="700">

        <p>
        For this plot I sum the elements that are symmetric about the 
        diagonal (e.g. (17,20) + (20,17)), and then divide these elements by 
        that sum. From this plot we get an idea of how frequent certain scores 
        are relative to home vs away outcome. What's interesting about this 
        plot is that it highlights how very lopsided games tend to very 
        strongly favor the home team, for example how shutouts are almost 
        always by home teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        <br><br>So overall, I would say that the home team has a definitive 
        quantitative advantage.
